        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - This paper provides a guideline for how to clean messy datasets in an efficient and effective way.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The tidy data standard intends to ease the exploration process of the data, as well as, facilitate analysis and simplify the tools that are used for such analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The first sentence explains that all datasets are unique in their variables and observations which causes them to have problems that are unique to their dataset, however, datasets are all structured in a similar way.\n",
        "    - The second sentence alludes to the complexity of gathering real data because often it is tricky to separate variables from observations because the questions you ask may change which is which.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Wickham defines values as numbers or strings that belong to a variable and an observation. A variable, thus, contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. Whereas, an observation contains all values measured on the same unit, but across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Wickham defines tidy dta as being comprised of three qualities: 1) each variable forms a column, 2) each observation forms a row, 3) each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The five most common problems with messey data are: 1) column headers are values, not variable names, 2) multiple variables are stored in one column, 3) variables are stored in both rows and columns, 4) multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, 5) a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "    - The data in Table 4 are messy because they have values in the column names.\n",
        "    - Melting the dataset means that you transform columns into rows which creates two new variables: one that contains repeated column headings and one that contains the data values from the previously separate columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Table 11 is messy because the column \"element\" contains the names of variables not values. Table 12 is considered tidy and molten because because there is now one row for each observation and the column \"element\" was replaced with two columns \"tmax\" and \"tmin\".\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The chicken-and-egg problem with tidy data is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data.\n",
        "    - Wickham hopes the future will bring better tools and strategies to facilitate the data wrangling process like matching similar but not identical values or filling in structural missing values."
